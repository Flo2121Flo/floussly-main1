## Infrastructure Setup

### DNS Configuration
```hcl
# Route53 Configuration
resource "aws_route53_zone" "floussly" {
  name = "floussly.com"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "www" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.floussly.zone_id
  name    = "www.floussly.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = "300"
  records = [aws_lb.main.dns_name]
}
```

### SSL/TLS Configuration
```hcl
# ACM Certificate
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "floussly" {
  domain_name       = "floussly.com"
  validation_method = "DNS"
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

### S3 Bucket Policy
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "EnforceEncryption",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::floussly-uploads/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Configuration

### Secrets Rotation Policy
```hcl
# Parameter Store Rotation Policy
resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "database_url" {
  name        = "/floussly/database-url"
  description = "Database connection string"
  type        = "SecureString"
  value       = "initial-value"
  
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [value]
  }
}

resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "jwt_secret" {
  name        = "/floussly/jwt-secret"
  description = "JWT signing key"
  type        = "SecureString"
  value       = "initial-value"
  
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [value]
  }
}
```

### WAF Rules
```hcl
resource "aws_wafv2_web_acl" "floussly" {
  name        = "floussly-waf"
  description = "WAF rules for Floussly"
  scope       = "REGIONAL"

  default_action {
    allow {}
  }

  rule {
    name     = "RateLimit"
    priority = 1

    override_action {
      none {}
    }

    statement {
      rate_based_statement {
        limit              = 2000
        aggregate_key_type = "IP"
      }
    }

    visibility_config {
      cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
      metric_name               = "RateLimit"
      sampled_requests_enabled  = true
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### CloudWatch Alarms
```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "cpu_utilization" {
  alarm_name          = "floussly-cpu-utilization"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/ECS"
  period             = "300"
  statistic          = "Average"
  threshold          = "80"
  alarm_description  = "This metric monitors ECS CPU utilization"
  alarm_actions      = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "memory_utilization" {
  alarm_name          = "floussly-memory-utilization"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "MemoryUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/ECS"
  period             = "300"
  statistic          = "Average"
  threshold          = "80"
  alarm_description  = "This metric monitors ECS memory utilization"
  alarm_actions      = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "error_rate" {
  alarm_name          = "floussly-error-rate"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "1"
  metric_name         = "5XXError"
  namespace           = "AWS/ApplicationELB"
  period             = "60"
  statistic          = "Sum"
  threshold          = "10"
  alarm_description  = "This metric monitors 5XX errors"
  alarm_actions      = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]
}
```

## Compliance & Audit

### Audit Logging Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "audit_logs" {
  name              = "/floussly/audit-logs"
  retention_in_days = 365
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter" "sensitive_operations" {
  name           = "sensitive-operations"
  pattern        = "{ $.eventType = \"SENSITIVE_OPERATION\" }"
  log_group_name = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.audit_logs.name

  metric_transformation {
    name      = "SensitiveOperations"
    namespace = "Floussly/Audit"
    value     = "1"
  }
}
```
